## Abstract: 
This project presents a secure image transmission and storage system using the Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) algorithm. The system encrypts images using Triple DES, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. The encrypted images are then transmitted over a network and stored securely. The system also provides a decryption mechanism to retrieve the original images. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of Triple DES in securing image data and provides a reliable solution for image transmission and storage.

Keywords: Image Security, Triple DES, Encryption, Decryption, Secure Image Transmission, Secure Image Storage, Digital Rights Management, Confidentiality, Integrity, Authenticity.
